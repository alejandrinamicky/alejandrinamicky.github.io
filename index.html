                            <h3>1) Bridge campus through monthly events that connect diverse students and facilitate dialogue between differing opinions</h3>
                            <p>The University of Texas attracts students from across the state and the world, reflecting diverse backgrounds and all ends of the sociopolitical spectrum. While this environment provides Longhorns a fantastic opportunity to learn about differing perspectives, people often do not interact outside of their local network. To connect student leaders, we will partner with the organization Texas Leaders to host monthly ‘Mix & Mingle’ and speed dating events. To facilitate conversations on relevant campus and national topics, we will hold monthly dialogues with organizations who hold opposing viewpoints. To make it easier for student organizations to publicize events, we will create a flyer map resource that shows the location and approval process for all on-campus flyers. Finally, to spark spontaneous connections across campus, we will push a ‘Skip the Small Talk’ day that hands out “big talk” questions and encourages deep conversations across campus.</p>
                            <h3>2) Create a new Student Government position that collaborates with the Gender & Sexuality Center and Multicultural Engagement Center</h3>
                            <p>In such a large and growing community as ours, Student Government has not consistently maintained strong enough relationships with the Multicultural Engagement Center and the Gender and Sexuality Center. To improve communication and collaboration between these three entities, we will create a new agency directorship within Student Government. The directorship will be responsible for facilitating cross collaboration by  keeping up with the goals, projects and achievements of the MEC and GSC and relaying this information to Student Government.</p>
                            <h3>3) Support trans students in the process of changing their names on diplomas to reflect their gender identity</h3>
                            <p>Transgender students face several hardships on campus  in relation to their gender identity and expression. Many trans students face hiring difficulties because the name on their academic diplomas is the one on their birth certificates, and not the name that reflects their identity. Many trans students are unaware that they can actually change their name to reflect their gender on academic diplomas. We will provide a Student Government liaison between the Texas Law TransGender Marker Project, and Trans students to offer support in this process. We will ensure that every UT student has access to the accurate reflection of  their names on their diploma.</p>

                            <p>Off-campus housing companies often do not fully accommodate disabled or differently-abled students. When issues arise, these students bear the burden of holding building management accountable. We do not think students should handle that responsibility alone. We will work with Services for Students with Disabilities and UT Legal to designate a staff member to help students with disabilities navigate conversations about necessary accommodations with housing complexes. A partnership between SSD, UT Legal, and students would ensure accountability on the part of off-campus housing companies and the wellbeing of all students.</p>
                            <h3>2) Secure an accessible van for UT’s Police Department</h3>
                            <p>Currently, UTPD offers rides home to students every night from 8 pm to 2 am. While this is a fantastic resource, it is not accessible to students who use electric wheelchairs or scooters. Not having the ability to use this resource is problematic for disabled/differently abled students, especially on nights with dangerous or bad weather conditions. We are committed to working with UTPD to secure funding to purchase vehicles that will allow all students to utilize this service from UTPD. All UT students should have equal access to campus-wide resources and Safety includes all communities – the disabled/differently abled community must not be forgotten. </p>

                            <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/circus.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> -->

                            <h3>1) Work with Voices Against Violence, Student Emergency Services, and Title IX to permanently fund the Interpersonal Violence Peer Support Program</h3>
                            <p>Interpersonal violence prevention and awareness efforts are most impactful in the form of grassroot, student-led movements that have the university’s backing. Voices Against Violence (VAV), Student Emergency Services, and Title IX have created the Interpersonal Violence Peer Support (IVPS) Program, which aims to support survivors of interpersonal violence (sexual violence, relationship violence, and stalking). Starting in Fall 2017, selected students will be trained to assist anyone who requests confidential support, resources, or information on University policies, procedures, and reporting options. Through extensive training and access to VAV resources, IVPS would fully equip student leaders to support survivors on campus. Furthermore, providing a wage to those involved with IVPS will incentivize student leaders to be reliable and give back to their peers. We want to ensure that any student who has been impacted by interpersonal violence is able to access resources and that all survivors at UT have a support system with a permanently funded IVPS.</p>
                            <h3>2) Expand training for on and off-campus resident assistants on sexual assault prevention and intervention</h3>
                            <p>Currently, on-campus resident assistants only receive a one-hour training session from Voices Against Violence regarding the prevention and intervention of sexual assault. However, freshmen are the most at risk of experiencing sexual violence and are often least educated on the issue. We will increase the time and resources devoted to training RAs in different ways of preventing or intervening in instances of sexual assault, and expand the same training to RA’s of private, off-campus dorms. Furthermore, once trained, RAs will educate their residents on the importance of consent, bystander intervention, and male responsibility. We understand that effective prevention begins with cultural competency, and hope to bring that focus to any effort against interpersonal violence.</p>

                            <h3>1) Create a textbook exchange program</h3>
                            <p>Textbook prices are on the rise nationwide, and some students pay more than $300 for textbooks each semester. We will partner with the university to create a program that allows students to exchange textbooks for popular introductory courses. The systems currently in place require students to pay high fees, and having a university sponsored resource will allow students to get textbooks they need at comparatively cheaper rates.</p>
                            <h3>2) Expand paid career-oriented opportunities on campus</h3>
                            <p>As many undergraduates know, college students need plenty of experience to enter the workforce after leaving the Forty Acres. While on campus, most students work jobs that help pay for their college expenses, not ones that advance their career interests. We want to fund campus research grants through Student Government to expand career-related work opportunities for our fellow longhorns. This will maintain and improve our standing as a Public Research Institution, connect students to networking opportunities with professors on campus, and increase student connections to the campus environment. </p>
                            <h3>3) Work with apartment complexes to allow non-conventional guarantor forms</h3>
                            <p>Students from low and middle income families can struggle to secure leases in neighborhoods close to campus because of their family’s’ financial standing. However, these same students often have large financial assets (loans, scholarships, grants etc.) which guarantee that they can cover their housing expenses. Students should be able to utilize these funds as a guaranty for their lease. We will work with apartment complexes to give students this option and thus give them more freedom in choosing where they want to live.</p>
                            <h3>4) Create an online database with student housing options available in Austin</h3>
                            <p>Austin has a diverse market of houses, apartments, and condos, but a recurring complaint of students is finding affordable housing. Currently, there is no comprehensive way to search for the place that’s right for you. Unlike many other Tier 1 Universities, UT is not involved in off-campus housing. We aim to change that – The University should work with companies in West Campus and Riverside to create a searchable database for students to shop around for their next housing location. This website would allow students to tailor their search to their budget and other preferences like distance from campus, amenities, and type of residence.</p>

                            <p>First-Year Interest Groups (FIGs) are integrated UT communities that have the potential to shape the culture of our university.  People that serve others lead happier lives, and we want to better incorporate acts of service into the UT lifestyle. This starts with the first-year experience. We want to make service opportunities specific to the FIG’s focus area an integral part of the cohort. Serving Austin’s many needs can be done in countless ways. For example, the Art & Design FIG might paint murals in East Austin, while the Mechanical Engineering FIG may lead middle school robotics clubs. By doing this, all Longhorns will find their unique ways to serve.</p>
                            <h3>2) Increase the impact of UT’s day of service, The Project</h3>
                            <p>The Project is UT’s largest service event, bringing in up to 2,000 students who contribute   almost 10,000 hours of service in a single day. While the impact of The Project cannot be discounted, universities like Texas A&M and Villanova have nearly half of their student bodies participate in similar projects. We believe there is room for significant improvement at UT. We will encourage and incentivize student organizations to participate by sponsoring a site, using Student Government resources to enhance The Project’s current outreach efforts, and working with the Department of Diversity and Community Engagement to increase the amount of student management and control within The Project. We hope to ingrain The Project into Longhorn culture, and expand one of our most impactful traditions.</p>

                            <p>For 118 years, the Texas v. Texas A&M football game embodied Longhorn tradition. Sadly, in 2011, it was played for what was assumed to be the last time. We have already spoken with Texas Athletics, Texas A&M students, and the Texas Exes alumni network; together, we will coordinate a statewide movement with students, alumni, and fans of both universities all coming together to support the game’s return. The key to reinstating the rivalry game is to work closely with UT Athletics and maintain an open dialogue with Texas A&M Athletics until we have reached our final goal. While our future non-conference schedule means we cannot play immediately, it is important that we work closely with athletics and consider realistic solutions to make this dream a reality. Without a doubt, playing our oldest rival will provide Longhorns a yearly tradition to rally around.</p>

                            <p>Her first two years in college, she didn’t like SG because she thought it was an exclusive organization that accomplished little. In February of her sophomore year, her friend approached her to talk about making SG a more inclusive space. While Alejandrina was initially pumped, she became very hesitant when she realized the friend wanted her to run. She ended up turning in her forms an hour before the deadline, and after serving as a University-Wide Representative last year, she realized that SG is a vehicle for improving campus. She has seen how especially important representation is in order to advocate for underrepresented communities on campus. Her different identities - being differently abled, Latina, and a woman - allows her to bring together different communities to the frontlines of spaces that they may not have otherwise been involved with. For her, running for this position is all about representation, advocacy, and empowerment.</p>

                            <p>Micky is a 3rd generation Longhorn who used to cry when UT would lose football games. While he no longer cries after losses, at least publicly, his passion for UT has only grown. He finds he is most happy when feeling connected to something greater than himself or seeing the tangible impact his work has on others. When a friend told him that the Texas Leaders Conference was the best 5 hours he’d ever spent at UT, Micky realized he wanted to have that type of impact on student’ experiences as much as possible. While his interests and involvement at UT so far have been quite varied, he thinks that executive alliance will enable him to create the most impact on other students. He feels that he will never love another place as much as he loves the Forty Acres, and, for him, doing this role is all about serving and giving back to this university as much as possible.</p>
